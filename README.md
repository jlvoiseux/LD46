**Picturesque** is a narrative game where you explore a short story while restoring an old painting. Uncover the whereabouts of the different characters as you try to bring the seascape back to life ! 

## Gameplay (spoiler : do not expect much here ; this plays more like a visual novel than anything, so brace yourself for some text.)

The game is divided in two phases : painting restoration and story scenes. During restoration phases, use your brush (your mouse) to clean up the painting and reveal its contents. Story scenes play just like a visual novel ; sit back and enjoy the dialogue !
